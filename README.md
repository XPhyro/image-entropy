# image-entropy
This repository contains the source code of an ongoing research project on image
entropy assessment. More details will be given at a later stage of the research.

Under `src/research/`, the source code of the first phase of this research is
contained; namely, comparing and developing different image entropy assessment
methods and testing & benchmarking. The code requires Python >=3.6.

Under `src/development/`, the chosen entropy assessment method is integrated
into a convolutional neural network. The code requires Python 3.7.

All code are tested on Linux with an NVIDIA GPU. They may not work on other
systems.
